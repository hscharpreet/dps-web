          Parents who are applying for a place in Early Years may wish to visit
          the school prior to this, so feel free to contact us to have a look
          around the school and meet with the Headteacher and Head of Early
          Years.

          Places will be offered on receipt of the application form and once
          accepted, then the place is guaranteed. Early application is
          encouraged, as there is a maximum number of children that we can
          accommodate. There is a minimum requirement of 4 sessions per week.
          When start dates have been confirmed, we offer a settling in session
          prior to your child’s arrival.
